# RollingHousingSalesNYC
The purpose of this project is to analyze The Department of Finance's Rolling Housing Sales for Manhattan, NYC in the last 12 month period (May 2016 to April 2017).

For this analysis we will use public data that can be found at:  http://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-rolling-sales-data.page.  These files include the neighborhood, building type, square footage, etc.

In this project you will find a folder named Data.Clean.  In this folder the raw data provided from the site above will be loaded and cleaned using R scripts.  Another folder, named Data.Analysis, will then take this prepped data and create a visual presentation of the square footage and sales prices.
